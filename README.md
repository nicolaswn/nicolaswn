Welcome, I'm Nicolas Negre and I am a Sophomore Computer Engineering student at the University of Texas at Dallas.
I'm interested cycling, cooking, automotive, and optimization. (And Computer Engineering, of course)

Right now, I'm looking forward to gas milage gauge for my 1999 Pontiac Grand AM, and tinker with a destop speaker set to make it Bluetooth compatible.
